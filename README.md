# Hi, I'm Sadie! üê±

I'm the lead maintainer of [InspIRCd](https://www.inspircd.org/) and a co-maintainer of [Anope](https://www.anope.org/). I am also a contributor to many other IRC projects such as [HexChat](https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/) (IRCv3 extension support, security improvements, general usability improvements, etc), [IRCv3](https://github.com/ircv3/), and [ircdocs](https://github.com/ircdocs/) and many other projects. My first open source project was published on SourceForge (remember that?) in March 2007.

If you are an IRC user please consider supporting me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/SadieCat), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/sadiepowell), or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/sadieelizabethpowell?country.x=GB&locale.x=en_GB). IRC is struggling to compete against commercial platforms and a big part of the reason why is that commercial platforms receive more funding in an hour than IRC projects get in a year. All contributions will be greatly appreciated. üíú

If you're looking for my personal projects I have decided to migrate them to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sadiepowell?tab=repositories). Codeberg is similar to GitHub only it is run by a German non-profit and is fully open source. Whilst I still use GitHub for community projects because of the network effect I feel that Codeberg's ethos matches more with my own for my personal projects.

If you are an remote work employer that can hire or contract with UK residents I'm currently looking for a job. I primarily specialise in C++  but am also familiar with C, Ruby, Perl, CMakeLang, GNU Make, and Unix Shell and I'm currently in the process of familiarising myself with the details of Python and Rust. I am also very familiar with several associated areas such as collaborative development, Linux system administration, software deployment and version control. Please email me at sadie@sadie.moe with your job details and pay range and I can send you a more detailed CV.
